# File Cabinet
---
This is a simple clone of Evernote where the user can log in,
take some notes, save them and view them.
This app is written using Rails, Haml, Html and Sass.

Some of the gems I used :
* devise
* simple_form
* haml
* pg
* rails12factor

You can find a live app [here](https://blooming-meadow-50584.herokuapp.com/).
